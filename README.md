# SwipingTabs
Fill the form out and swipe between two screens using Tabs.

The app is a brief example of how ViewPager and PageAdapter work. This is the easiest way of 
implement Tabs and different screens in your app.

We avoid to use Fragments here because I reckon it is a higher level than PageAdapters and 
it was easier for me to understand first how PageAdapter and ViewPager work.
Also, we can learn how to get views from layouts inflated into the ViewPager using the customize PageAdapter.

Fill the form and press the floating button below. Then, a Snackbar will appear 
verifying that the data was dumped into the second screen.

First Screen: Form
